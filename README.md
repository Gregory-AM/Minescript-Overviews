# Minescript-Javaclass-Overview

This guide was created for minescript to provide starter information on the JavaClass() function.

## Mappings

Assuming you are on minescript release 4.0b or later, you can run `\install_mappings` in your chat to load them in.

This is a necessary step (for obfuscated versions) that tells your client what name goes in a human-readable format instead of something like `ba.s2(5, 10, 20)`

## Javaclass()

Pyjinn has Javaclass automatically imported from `system.pyj.minescript`, but your .py files will require either `java` (recent versions) or `lib_java` (legacy)
